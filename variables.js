// OSCAR POCO

//Exercise 1

let name = "Oscar Poco"; 
// my name is "Oscar", on this line of code

let age = 23; 
// I am 23 years old , and as you can see that me my 23 doesnt have qoutation mark because this is an integer

let isStdudent = True; 
// I assigned the True because I am a student

// I used semicolon after every line, this is because I am terminating that code to show that this line of code ends here it doesn't continue

// now I am printing all the 3 variables

console.log("Name:", name);
console.log("Name:", age);
console.log("Is a student: ", isStdudent);


//Exercise 2

let favoriteColour = "White";
console.log("My favorite colour is", favoriteColour);

favoriteColour = "Golden Yellow";
console.log("My new favorite colour is", favoriteColour);
// This code from line 26-27 , I didnt use the keyword "let" to assign a new variable because when we are reassigning we don't use it, we only use "let" when we are assigning for the first time
// and the original value of my favorite colour is going to be replaced by the new colour, and when i print this on terminal , the new colour is going to be desplayed instead of the old original colour

// Exercise 3

let num1 = 20, num2 = 5;
// This code declares 2 variables at the same time, I like this because it saves time

let sum = num1 + num2, product = num1 * num2, difference = num1 - num2, quotient = num1 / num2;
// This code uses a single line with only 1 "let" function, which saves time

//Now printing all the variables
console.log("Sum is", sum);
console.log("Product is", product);
console.log("Difference is", difference);
console.log("Quotient is", quotient);
